<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustic-rs" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rustic-rs.svg" alt="crate"></a>
<p>rustic is a backup tool that provides fast, encrypted, deduplicated backups written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>.
It reads and writes the <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic" rel="noopener noreferrer">restic</a> repo format described in the <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/doc/design.rst" rel="noopener noreferrer">design document</a>
and can be used as a restic replacement in most cases.</p>
<p>Rustic supports the major operating systems (Linux, MacOs, *BSD), Windows support is experimental.</p>
<p>Note that rustic currently is in a beta release and misses regression tests.</p>
