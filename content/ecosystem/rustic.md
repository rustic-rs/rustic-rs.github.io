# About

*rustic* is a backup tool that provides fast, encrypted, deduplicated backups.

It reads and writes the [restic][1] repo format described in the
[design document][2] and can be used as a *restic* replacement in most cases.

It is implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a performant,
memory-efficient, and reliable cross-platform systems programming language.

Hence *rustic* supports all major operating systems (Linux, MacOs, *BSD), with
Windows support still being experimental.

# Features

- Backup data is **deduplicated** and **encrypted**.
- Backup storage can be local or cloud storages, including cold storages.
- Allows multiple clients to **concurrently** access a backup repository using
  lock-free operations.
- Backups by default are append-only on the repository.
- The operations are robustly designed and can be **safely aborted** and
  **efficiently resumed**.
- Snapshot organization is possible by hostname, backup paths, label and tags.
  Also a rich set of metadata is saved with each snapshot.
- Retention policies and cleaning of old backups can be **highly customized**.
- Follow-up backups only process changed files, but still create a complete
  backup snapshot.
- In-place restore only modifies files which are changed.
- Uses config files for easy configuration of all every-day commands, see
  [example config files](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/tree/main/config).

# Minimum Rust version policy

This crate's minimum supported `rustc` version is `1.70.0`.

The current policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate
can be increased in minor version updates. For example, if `crate 1.0` requires
Rust 1.20.0, then `crate 1.0.z` for all values of `z` will also require Rust
1.20.0 or newer. However, `crate 1.y` for `y > 0` may require a newer minimum
version of Rust.

In general, this crate will be conservative with respect to the minimum
supported version of Rust.
